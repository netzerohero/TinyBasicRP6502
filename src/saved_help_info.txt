#TINY BASIC
#
#RP6502 port of Tom Pittman's TINY BASIC.
#
#TINY BASIC is an important milestone in computer history. With origins associated with
#Dr. Dobb's Journal - DDJ, it stood in contrast to costly Microsoft's BASIC.
#
#Internally, TINY BASIC runs its own intermediate-language byte-code interpretter (TBIL)
#of the TinyBasic language. Porting to different CPUs involved re-using the TBIL program, 
#only have to port the native Machine-Language (ML) code to the varity of CPUs that runs TinyBasic.
#
#As Tom Pittman says from his TINY BASIC User Manual from 1976:
#
#TINY BASIC was conceived by the dragons at the People's
#Computer Company (PCC), a non-profit corporation in Menlo Park CA.
#and its implementation defined by Dennis Allison and others in the
#PCC newspaper and an offshoot newsletter [DDJ].  [TINY BASIC] follows 
#the philosophy defined there.  [Refer] to PCC v.4 Nos 1-3 
#for a discussion of the inner workings of this software.
#      In keeping with the "small is good" philosophy, TINY BASIC
#employs the two level interpreter approach (with its consequent speed
#cost) so that the whole system occupies only 2K of program memory.
#With 1K of additional RAM small but useful user programs (50 lines or
#less) may be accommodated. A system with 4K of RAM can contain the
#interpreter and about 100 lines of user program.
